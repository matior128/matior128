- 👋 Hi, I’m Mateusz Wojciechowski
- 👀 I’m interested in designing databases in SQL Server and creating front-end websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and jQuery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that create large database systems and administer them properly in SQL Server. In the future, I want to work as a Front-End
     developer.
